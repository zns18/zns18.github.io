<p class="lead">The multidomain calcium-binding β γ-crystallin proteins are particularly important, as their deterioration and misfolding/aggregation is associated with melanoma tumors and cataracts. Here we investigate the mechanical stability and conformational dynamics of a model calcium-binding β γ-crystallin protein, Protein S, and elaborate on its interactions with calcium. Our results from single-molecule force-spectroscopy (SMFS) show that the N-terminal (but not the C-terminal) domain is in equilibrium with an alternative conformation in the absence of Ca2+, which is mechanically stable in contrast to other proteins that were observed to sample a molten globule under similar conditions. We find that up to 1% of all identified multidomain calcium-binding proteins contain a similarly site and therefore may exploit a similar compensatory mechanism to prevent structural instability in the absence of ligand.</p>

<p>Automation can be accomplished using an algorithm that triages usable force–extension recordings quickly with positive and negative selection. We implemented an algorithm based on the windowed fast Fourier transform of force–extension traces that identifies peaks using force–extension regimes to correctly identify usable recordings from proteins composed of repeated domains. </p>



<p>This algorithm excels as a real-time diagnostic because it involves <30 ms computational time, has high sensitivity and specificity, and efficiently detects weak unfolding events. We used the statistics provided by the automated procedure to clearly demonstrate the properties of molecular adhesion and how these properties change with differences in the cantilever tip and protein functional groups and protein age.</p>
